NAME
    Graphics::ColorNames::EmergyC - Eco-friendly web-design color-palette.

SYNOPSIS
      require Graphics::ColorNames::EmergyC;

      $NameTable = Graphics::ColorNames::EmergyC->NamesRgbTable();
      $RgbBlack  = $NameTable->{black};

DESCRIPTION
    The Emergy-C color palette is based on the EnergyStar wattage ratings
    for different colors. Supposedly, a display mainly using colors of this
    palette uses on average only about 3 or 4 watts more than a completely
    black screen. White is included as an accent color, only for a small
    proportion of the screen.

    Since it is a minimal palette, you may want to use it in conjunction
    with other palettes.
